# Covid-19 Test Center Locator

The COVID-19 Test Center Locator allows users to acquire addresses, phone numbers and hours of operations of test center locations in their state. This application is an ongoing project that utilizes a crowdsourced, regularly-updated API listing of testing locations. It currently provides information for twelve states in the US.

**User Story:**

- GIVEN I am a user looking for health institutions with COVID-19 testing
- WHEN I choose a state from the drop-down menu
- THEN I get a list of testing locations in that state with the organization name, address, phone number and hours of operation. Additionally, markers populate for those locations on the map.
- WHEN I click on a map marker
- THEN an information window pops up with the organization name, address and a ‘Search Location’ link. Additionally, the scroll box will show the information of the location selected.
- WHEN I click on the ‘Search Location’ link in the information window
- THEN a search engine opens up with that address
- WHEN I go to the statistics section
- THEN I see a current view of overall statistics within the United States that gets updated daily
